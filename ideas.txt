14:24:15 <joseph> you should put a demo up
14:24:18 <joseph> demos are always nice
14:24:45 <pil> as an applet? Or how dou you think?

14:25:20 <joseph> perhaps just a big editable text box
14:25:27 <joseph> click submit, and see the generated stuff
14:25:39 <pil> yeah, good idea
14:25:54 <joseph> or do it all on one page so you can click "update" button instead, and see the graphic change
