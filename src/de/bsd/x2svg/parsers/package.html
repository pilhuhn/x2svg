This package contains parsers for the various input files.
Those parsers need to implement the interface {@link de.bsd.x2svg.parsers.InputParser}.
This interface provides a number of methods, to more or less live on their own, so that
adding a new parser is done by implementing those interfaces. The loader in
{@link de.bsd.x2svg.ParserLoader} can then determine all important parameters,
instantiate and return the right parser without changes in other parts of the code.
<p/>
Parsers register a file suffix they are trigered upon, but this automatic mechanism
can be overriden by specifiying an explicit working mode on the command line (think
e.g. of an XML Schema, where the suffix would .xsd, but which was saved as .xml, so the
automatic determination of the parser to take would fail).
<p/>
When parsers got first loaded by the system as plugins, they need to be instantiated
in order to obtain the mode, file suffix and help line from them. So if you are writing
an {@link de.bsd.x2svg.parsers.InputParser} which is expenisve to set up (e.g. 
getting data from a remote location), you might only want to do this when the 
{@link de.bsd.x2svg.parsers.InputParser#parseInput()} method is called.
